)
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The overarching domain of creating machines capable of mimicking human intelligence.
- **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI where machines learn from data to improve performance over time without explicit programming.
- **Deep Learning (DL):** A specialized branch of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to analyze and interpret data.

### 1.2 Types of Machine Learning
![Types of Machine Learning]()
- **Supervised Learning:** Learn from labeled data to make predictions or classifications.
  - Example: Predicting house prices based on historical data.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Explore and infer patterns in unlabeled data.
  - Example: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Learn optimal actions through reward-based feedback.
  - Example: Teaching a robot to navigate a maze.

### 1.4 Unsupervised Learning & Its Types
![Unsupervised Learning](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Unsupervised+Learning)
- **Clustering:** Group similar data points together.
  - Example: Customer segmentation.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining essential information.
  - Example: Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
